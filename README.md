# OmmNomm
## When tastiness overpowers the need for speech

OmmNomm is a collection of recipes, I have either tested or will test in the near future. It is an ever growing database and idea generator. Welcome to the tastiness.  

### Software
I manage my recipes in Paprika, on both my Macbook Air and iPhone. Paprika is amazing for breaking down recipes into categories: entrees, chicken, dairy etc. The customization and detail that can be applied to each recipe far exceeds any program I have come across. You can rate your recipes, attach pictures of each dish, add in nutritional information and your cooking instructions. You can create your own cookbook-worthy recipes!

### Diet
Julia Child once said
> "The only time to eat diet food is while you're waiting for the steak to cook." 

These recipes do not follow a specific diet. I personally count macros, even before calories, as I find this leads to the most balanced and healthy diet for *me*. I am not a nutritionist; just a foodie who loves to try new recipes and shove tasty things into my mouth. 

### Recipes 
OmmNomm will be ever-evolving. Recipes will come, but I won't delete any. Some recipes that I find difficult, or that didn't mesh with my taste buds, may be rockstars to others. 
> “This is my invariable advice to people: Learn how to cook- try new recipes, learn from your mistakes, be fearless, and above all have fun!” **Julia Child**

### My Food Spirit Person
> “Find something you're passionate about and keep tremendously interested in it.”**Julia Child** 

 I have read Julia's book *My life in France*,  owned and tried recipes from *Mastering the Art of French Cooking*, and watch reruns of *The French Chef*  on PBS. Julia is a great personality. She aproaches food in a way we should all aproach life: have a passion, and never let anything get in the way of it. If you mess life/food up, you grit your teeth, take it, and try again.
> “The only real stumbling block is fear of failure. In cooking you've got to have a what-the-hell attitude.”
