It is an ever growing database and idea generator. Welcome to the tastiness.  \r\n\r\n### Software\r\nI manage my recipes in Paprika, on both my Macbook Air and iPhone. Paprika is amazing for breaking down recipes into categories: entrees, chicken, dairy etc. The customization and detail that can be applied to each recipe far exceeds any program I have come across. You can rate your recipes, attach pictures of each dish, add in nutritional information and your cooking instructions. You can create your own cookbook-worthy recipes!\r\n\r\n### Diet\r\nJulia Child once said\r\n> \"The only time to eat diet food is while you're waiting for the steak to cook.\" \r\n\r\nThese recipes do not follow a specific diet. I personally count macros, even before calories, as I find this leads to the most balanced and healthy diet for *me*. I am not a nutritionist; just a foodie who loves to try new recipes and shove tasty things into my mouth. \r\n\r\n### Recipes \r\nOmmNomm will be ever-evolving. Recipes will come, but I won't delete any. Some recipes that I find difficult, or that didn't mesh with my taste buds, may be rockstars to others. \r\n> “This is my invariable advice to people: Learn how to cook- try new recipes, learn from your mistakes, be fearless, and above all have fun!” **Julia Child**\r\n\r\n### My Food Spirit Person\r\n> “Find something you're passionate about and keep tremendously interested in it.”**Julia Child** \r\n\r\n I have read Julia's book *My life in France*,  owned and tried recipes from *Mastering the Art of French Cooking*, and watch reruns of *The French Chef*  on PBS. Julia is a great personality. She aproaches food in a way we should all aproach life: have a passion, and never let anything get in the way of it. If you mess life/food up, you grit your teeth, take it, and try again.\r\n> “The only real stumbling block is fear of failure. In cooking you've got to have a what-the-hell attitude.”\r\n\r\n### Favorite Recipe Sites\r\n* http://www.bbcgoodfood.com\r\n* http://www.yummly.com\r\n* http://www.epicurious.com\r\n* http://stalkerville.net/site/dessert/\r\n* http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/\r\n* http://www.thekitchn.com\r\n* http://www.chow.com\r\n* http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
